      	<h1>Policies</h1>
<h2 id="late-submissions">Late Submissions</h2>
<p>Barring exceptional circumstances, I will not accept your portfolios after the due date. Belated entries in your notebook will negatively influence your final mark. Since entries are intended to build upon each other, I recommend that you do not fall behind on them. Also, I will not comment on entries submitted after the due date. Of note, the presentation can only occur during the final meeting of the semester.</p>
<h2 id="absences">Absences</h2>
<p>Weekly attendance in graduate courses is expected. If you must be absent from a course for a serious reason, then you should contact me before the missed class and explain why you will not be in attendance. Cases of continuous, unexplained absence will result in a penalty to your grade or your ineligibility to complete the course. Attendance and active participation in discussions and workshops are part of fulfilling the course requirements. I will notify the Graduate Adviser if you have three or more unwarranted absences.</p>
<h2 id="laptops">Laptops</h2>
<p>Laptops are welcome in (but not required for) the seminar.</p>
<h2 id="extensions">Extensions</h2>
<p>No extensions will be given except in extreme (and verifiable) circumstances. These circumstances include reasons of health and extenuating circumstances, such as death of a family member.</p>
<h2 id="learning-climate">Learning Climate</h2>
<p>The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the UVic human rights policy. You should alert me immediately if you have any questions about this policy and its application, or if you have concerns about course proceedings or participants.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Students are expected to adhere to the UVic academic integrity policy. Violations of this policy will result in a failing grade for the given assignment and may additionally result in a failing grade for the course. By taking this course, you agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review. I do not use software to detect plagiarism in essays or any other assignments.</p>
<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a disability/health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or the Resource Centre for Students with a Disability (RCSD) as soon as possible. RCSD staff is available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let us know your needs, the sooner we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.</p>
<h2 id="email">Email</h2>
<p>With the exception of holidays and weekends, I respond to your emails within twenty-four hours.</p>
