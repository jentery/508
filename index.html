<a id="week-1" class="anchor" href="#week-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 1 | 4 January | Interpretation through Alteration</h3>

<p>Why interpret texts by altering them? What are some low-tech approaches to prototyping and interpreting texts in a whiz-bang world? How do we think about design and fiction together? </p>
