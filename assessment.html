      	<h1>Format</h1>
You will be required to keep entries in a notebook, create your own prototypes of a historical text (as part of the notebook), give a presentation, and compile a portfolio, which will integrate your prototypes into a collection of observations about your selected -ism. These portfolios will treat prototypes as evocative objects for describing your text, reflecting on your work, and projecting toward next steps. They will not act as seminar papers or follow the conventions of academic journal articles. For our purposes during seminar, “prototype” will be synonymous with “alteration” or even “version.” 

Below is a list of the assignments, together with a description of what is expected for each and how they will be assessed. Please note that the requirements are subject to minor changes as the seminar progresses. If I do make a change to any of the assignments, then I will notify you in writing and well in advance.
The portfolio and presentation are essential for passing the course. Failure to complete these two requirements will result in a failing N grade (calculated as a 0 for your GPA). Please also note: I do not post marks outside my office, and I do not use plagiarism detection software.

## Notebook (30%)
Throughout the semester, you will keep a notebook documenting your alterations to an -ism. Consisting of several simple experiments across digital and tactile media, your notebook will be frequently distributed during seminar, and you will be expected to comment on experiments and prototypes by your peers. Your notebook will be assessed holistically, meaning your work will be given one grade (at the semester’s end) based on its: (1) consistency, (2) development over time, (3) reflexive character, (4) integration of seminar discussions and workshops, (5) quality (including its combination of critique with creativity), and (6) attention to change. There will be a prompt for each entry in your notebook, and it will be related to a particular workshop, seminar discussion, and reading. The prompt will be circulated at least one week prior to the entry’s due date. Entries should be completed before seminar on the day they are due.

Near our sixth meeting of the semester, I will circulate an interim mark for your notebook. My intention for holistically assessing your notebook is not to keep you in the dark about your academic progress. It is to treat a notebook as it should be treated: as a genre that develops and increases in complexity over time. Please note that the tone and style of your notebooks should be less formal than, say, a seminar essay intended for an academic audience. Where applicable, entries should be self-aware and reflexive. In the notebook, please feel free to reference work being conducted by your peers or to spark dialogue with them. Please also feel free to combine your preferred modes of composition: writing, drawing, collage, outlining, etc. In so doing, you’ll likely need to create an online folder or repository to share digital files, and then point your peers and me to its URL. In fact, for our purposes during seminar, *your notebook should be considered a composition across digital and tactile media, with source material available offline and on*.

For the notebook, grades will be assigned based on the following scale:
* 90-100 = A+: Notebooks in this range are incredibly detailed, rife with documentation, and demonstrate new or innovative uses of specific methods or techniques. They respond to seminar discussions, are reflexive, and exhibit a combination of critical thinking, creativity, and awareness of media/materiality. 
* 85-89 = A: Notebooks in this range are incredibly detailed and rife with documentation. They respond to seminar discussions, are reflexive, and exhibit a combination of critical thinking, creativity, and awareness of media/materiality. 
* 80-84 = A-: Notebooks in this range are incredibly detailed and rife with documentation. They respond to seminar discussions and are reflexive.
* 77-79 = B+: Notebooks in this range are rife with documentation. They respond to seminar discussions and are reflexive.
* 73-76 = B: Research logs in this range are rife with documentation and respond to seminar discussions.

## Portfolio (40%)
Your portfolio should collect all the work you’ve done during seminar, curate it, and contextualize it with a cover letter (750-1000 words). The portfolio can be digital, tactile, or both, and it can be submitted online, by hand, or both. 

During the second half of the semester, I will circulate a prompt for the portfolio, detailing the requirements and expectations in consultation with you. For now, you should know that the portfolio should not be a seminar paper, and its primary function is to share or exhibit your work, not make an argument about it.  

For the portfolio, grades will be assigned based on the following scale:
* 90-100 = A+: Portfolios in this range are especially sophisticated and perceptive pieces of work that make an original contribution to scholarly thinking about a particular -ism. They could be published in a multimodal journal or exhibited in an academic venue.  
* 85-89 = A: Portfolios in this range are perceptive and original, but may require substantial revision for public circulation. They could act as core material for a conference presentation.  
* 80-84 = A-: Portfolios in this range are adequate at the graduate level with regard to the research, presentation, and quality of content.   
* 77-79 = B+: Portfolios in this range have significant flaws in some areas, but they still meet graduate standards.
* 73-76 = B: Portfolios in this range are marginally acceptable at the graduate level.

## Presentation (15%)
Your final presentation will assume the form of an informal talk drawn from a particular aspect of your seminar research and notebook. You will be asked to speak for four to five minutes, using a combination of media, with a four- to five-minute question-and-answer period. People from outside the seminar will be invited to attend the talk. 

For the final presentation, grades will be assigned based on the following scale:
* 90-100 = A+: Presentations in this range are incredibly compelling and even memorable. They demonstrate what was learned during the semester and provide clear evidence of that learning. They prompt the audience to ask questions, and they spark conversation about a concrete topic emerging from the seminar. They do not visibly rely much (if at all) on reading a prepared text. Their structure is tangible and easy to follow.
* 85-89 = A: Presentations in this range demonstrate what was learned during the semester and provide clear evidence of that learning. They prompt the audience to ask questions, and they spark conversation about a concrete topic emerging from the seminar. They do not visibly rely much (if at all) on reading a prepared text. Their structure is tangible and easy to follow.
* 80-84 = A-: Presentations in this range demonstrate what was learned during the semester and provide recognizable evidence of that learning. They prompt the audience to ask questions. They do not visibly rely much (if at all) on reading a prepared text. Their structure is tangible and easy to follow.
* 77-79 = B+: Presentations in this range demonstrate what was learned during the semester and provide recognizable evidence of that learning. They do not visibly rely much (if at all) on reading a prepared text. 
* 73-76 = B: Presentations in this range demonstrate what was learned during the semester and provide recognizable evidence of that learning. 

## Participation (15%) 
Discussion and invested participation are central to the graduate seminar format. That said, I will assess your contributions to the seminar this semester, including questions you ask, your involvement in workshops, your investment and role in dialogue, and your familiarity with the readings at hand. Near our sixth meeting, I will circulate interim participation grades.

For your participation mark, grades will be assigned based on the following scale:
* 90-100 = A+: Participation in this range demonstrates an incredibly high level of engagement with the course material. You are clearly familiar with the reading(s) at hand, actively engaged in workshops, sparking dialogue with your peers and me, listening attentively to others, and asking compelling questions, which have not occurred to me or your peers. 
* 85-89 = A: Participation in this range demonstrates a high level of engagement with the course material. You are clearly familiar with the reading(s) at hand, actively engaged in workshops, sparking dialogue with your peers and me, listening attentively to others, and asking important questions. 
* 80-84 = A-: Participation in this range demonstrates a high level of engagement with the course material. You are clearly familiar with the reading(s) at hand, actively engaged in workshops, sparking dialogue with your peers and me, and listening attentively to others. 
* 77-79 = B+: Participation in this range demonstrates an acceptable level of engagement with the course material. You are clearly familiar with the reading(s) at hand and actively engaged in workshops.
* 73-76 = B: Participation in this range suggests you are likely familiar with the reading(s) at hand and engaged in workshops.
