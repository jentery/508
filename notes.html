<h2><a id="week1"></a>Week 1 | 4 January | Interpretation through Alteration</h2>
<p>Hello! Welcome to 508. I'm looking forward to it. At some point during our first meeting, we should introduce ourselves and briefly review the <a href="index.html">syllabus</a>, which is also available in <a href="syllabus.pdf">PDF</a>. After you read the syllabus, please let me know of any concerns.</p>
<h3><a id="assumptionswk1"></a>Assumptions</h3>
<p>Let's start the seminar with some common assumptions about digital humanities (DH). If you don't mind, then I'd like to discuss each of these, with an emphasis on your familiarity with them and any questions you have.</p>
<ul>
<li>The field is a service. It merely develops and maintains digital resources for researchers. It does not interpret or meaningfully engage with pre-digital traditions in literary and cultural criticism.<br /></li>
<li>DH does not concern itself with the literary or aesthetic character of texts. It does not do hermeneutics. Instead, it is instrumentalist in character: a techno-solutionist byproduct of positivism and big data. It bypasses fiction and poetry for gadgets and whiz-bang.<br /></li>
<li>DH practitioners replace cultural perspectives with uncritical computer vision. Instead of privileging irony or ambiguity, they use computers to &quot;prove&quot; reductive claims about literature and culture, usually through graphs and totalizing visualizations. Literature and critical theory are subordinated to investments in data.<br /></li>
<li>To participate in the field, you must be fluent in computer programming, or at least willing to treat literature and culture quantitatively. If you are not a programmer, then you are not doing digital humanities.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="counter-assumptions"></a>Counter-assumptions</h3>
<p>During this seminar, I suggest we complicate and counter these assumptions by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doing digital studies without much, if any, interest in programming. For instance, I will not require you to conduct any programming exercises during workshops or outside of seminar. If you wish to apply programming to the material, then feel free. (I enjoy programming, too.)</li>
<li>Experimenting with a speculative thread of digital studies that is interested less in visualization, graphical expression, or big data and more in close reading, small data, and affordances (i.e., immeasurable yet specific relations between &quot;animal and environment&quot;; see <a target="_blank" href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/gibsonVisualPerception.pdf">J.J. Gibson in 1979 on &quot;The Ambient Optic Array&quot;</a>).</li>
<li>Accounting for the ways in which art resists, diffracts, or escapes interpretation (or remediation) by computer vision. This may be something as basic as a text that is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/may/01/scanner-ebook-arms-anus-optical-character-recognition">not conducive to optical character recognition</a> or search mechanisms; we might also consider the categorization and indexing of art via practices such as descriptive metadata.</li>
<li>Historicizing digital studies through legacies of experimental media and aesthetics prior to personal computing and the internet. One trick here will be negotiating our relationship with the &quot;avant-garde.&quot; For instance, can we balance assertions for autonomy or rupture with materialist investments in the everyday? Or, how do we address the ideologies overtly at work in avant-garde aesthetics?</li>
<li>Thinking through paradigms that do not privilege legibility, speed, massiveness, mining, or even discovery. Important question: can you manage such paradigms without relying on romantic individualism, or without assuming we can &quot;withdraw&quot; from the systems we interpret? I ask because I'm personally skeptical of recent, rather nostalgic obsessions with pre-digital living and labour. Can we maintain critiques of computational or algorithmic logic without inventing (or assuming) a history of &quot;simpler times&quot;? While I don't want to rely too much on qualifiers such as &quot;pre&quot; and &quot;post,&quot; I do wonder if we might unpack something like a &quot;post-digital&quot; approach to print and old media during this seminar. This approach might involve locating new media (see <a target="_blank" href="http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/manovichNewMedia.pdf">Manovich in 2001 on &quot;What Is New Media?&quot;</a>) in our everyday lives (as a given, as something banal or familiar) to then prototype alternative histories and possibilities. This way, &quot;digital&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;revolutionary&quot; or even &quot;novel.&quot; Maybe it's quite boring.<br /></li>
<li>Conducting a series of experiments that blend technique with conceptualization, stuff with ideas, maintenance with novelty, and material specificity with politics and aesthetics. These experiments might follow in a long tradition of dialectics accounting for relations between the abstract and particular.<br /></li>
<li>Resisting a &quot;make or break&quot; logic, with a bias instead toward &quot;care and repair&quot; as practices fundamental to literary and cultural practice. Later in the term, we'll specifically talk about alternatives to suspicion. For now, we might highlight how innovation and obsolescence operate through technologies (or &quot;technocultures&quot;; see <a target="_blank" href="http://pmc.iath.virginia.edu/text-only/issue.990/ross-1.990">Andrew Ross in 1990</a>).</li>
</ul>
