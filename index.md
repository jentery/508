# English 508 | Prototyping Texts: Interpretation through Alteration   
Jentery Sayers | University of Victoria | Spring 2016

## Course Description

In both theory and practice, this seminar brushes against four popular assumptions about digital humanities: 1) as a service to researchers, the field merely develops digital resources for online discovery and builds computational tools for end-users; it does not interpret texts or meaningfully engage with "pre-digital" traditions in literary and cultural criticism; 2) digital humanities is not concerned with the literary or aesthetic character of texts; it is a techno-solutionist byproduct of instrumentalism and big data; 3) digital humanities practitioners replace cultural perspectives with uncritical computer vision; instead of privileging irony or ambivalence, they use computers to "prove" reductive claims about literature and culture, usually through graphs and totalizing visualizations; and 4) to participate in the field, you must be fluent in computer programming, or at least be willing to treat literature and culture quantitatively; if you are not a programmer, then you are not doing digital humanities.

During our seminar meetings, we will counter these four assumptions by examining, historicizing, and creating "design fictions," which Bruce Sterling defines as "the deliberate use of diegetic prototypes to suspend disbelief about change." Design fictions typically have a futurist bent to them. They speculate about bleeding edge technologies and emerging dynamics, or they project whiz-bang worlds seemingly ripped from films such as *Minority Report*. But we'll refrain from much futurism. Instead, we will use new media and technologies to look backwards and prototype versions of text to facilitate interpretative practice. Inspired by Kari Kraus’s “conjectural criticism,” Bethany Nowviskie and Johanna Drucker’s “speculative computing,” Karen Barad’s “diffractive methods,” Jeffrey Schnapp’s  “small data,” Anne Balsamo’s “hermeneutic reverse-engineering,” and deformations by Jerome McGann, Lisa Samuels, and Mark Sample, we will conduct “what if” analyses of literary and cultural materials already at hand, in electronic format (e.g., page images in a library’s digital collections). 

Doing so will involve something peculiar: *interpreting our primary sources by altering them*. We'll substitute words, change formats, rearrange poems, remediate fictions, juxtapose images, bend texts, and reconstitute book arts. To be sure, such approaches have vexed legacies in the arts and humanities. Consider cut-ups, constrained writing, story-making machines, exquisite corpses, remixes, tactical media, Fluxkits, or détournement. Today, these avant-garde traditions are ubiquitous in a banal or depoliticized form, the default features of algorithmic culture and social networks. But we will refresh them, with a difference, by integrating our alterations into cultural criticism and prompting questions about the composition of art and history today. 

Our focus will be texts with charged design elements (experiments with fonts, typefaces, arrangement, simultaneity, synesthesia, space, time, and automation, to name a few) that were published between the 1870s and 1970s. These texts will correspond with various “-isms” from the period: Symbolism, Cubism, Nowism, Futurism, Dada, Expressionism, Imagism, Vorticism, Constructivism, Realism, Surrealism, Thingism, Concretism, Verticalism, Plasticism, and more. Early in the seminar, we will survey these -isms, and you will each be asked to research one in particular for a majority of the term. This research will involve bibliography and close reading together with the deliberate alteration of an –ism in order to foreground what made it compelling, or not so compelling, in the first place. 

Our aim, then, will not be to "prove" anything about literature and culture. It will not be build tools, reveal networks, learn some code, or share whiz-bang visualizations, either. It will be to design and make texts differently, to better understand their significance by not only refusing to take them at face value (a hermeneutic impulse) but also prototyping what else they could be(a design impulse).  

No experience with digital humanities is required for this seminar. Assumed technical competence: you know how to send an email. Please note, too, that this course involves a low-tech approach to digital humanities, with an emphasis on art, design, and aesthetics over computation, networks, distant reading, and big data. You will not be required to do any programming.

## Required Materials 

For this seminar, please acquire a high-quality notebook for conducting seminar exercises. You will be asked to periodically circulate this book during seminar but also submit it for review and assessment. I also recommend access to a computer. You will be asked to circulate digital materials via the file sharing mechanism (FTP, Google Drive, GitHub, Tumblr) of your choice. (I'll provide options here, in case you're unfamiliar with any.)  

## Assignments

A notebook (two marks, 25% each), presentation (10%), and final portfolio with cover letter (40%). With a focus on learning about materiality through material experimentation, this seminar will blend lecture and discussion with hands-on workshops across digital and tactile media. You will be required to keep logs in your notebook, create your own prototypes of a historical text, and compile a final portfolio, which will integrate your prototypes into a collection of observations about your selected -ism. These portfolios will treat prototypes as evocative objects for describing your text, reflecting on your work, and projecting toward next steps. They will not act as seminar papers or follow the conventions of academic journal articles.  

## Weekly Exercises 

Somewhere between design studies and literary studies, we will conduct a series of exercises where you will repeatedly alter a text across formats and media. Each exercise will be accompanied by a reading. For more details, see the schedule below.

## Week 2 | 11 January | Survey Some -Isms.

Between the 1870s and 1970s, what are some notable -isms operating across art, culture, and politics? How were these -isms designed? 

Read: Selections from Caws, [*Manifesto*](http://uvic.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?bookMark=ePnHCXMw42JgAfZbU5khZ9tYGACbB8A-gxkng4xvImi1BrBJY6XgqOAMKVIV8tMUPItzi7kZwtxcQ5w9dKE3AOgmGoM2SumCzt9KTTRPTrVIMzZOAbZdkg1TjFNS05JMzYF1taWpqYVRikka0IaU1ERgxWOYaGGWZpliCZ6eAnbQQVfiqkIMRp1Ujk8EDevHBwGdZ24G7AIYAQA8DDHD) | Collection of -isms | [Digital Manifesto Archive](http://www.digitalmanifesto.net/manifestos/) | [Modernist Journals Project](http://modjourn.org/) 
Notebook: Take notes on your general impressions of at least five -isms. 

## Week 3 | 18 January | Pick an -Ism.

What's your -ism? 

Notebook: Select an -ism you wish to study throughout the term as well as a key text (poem, manifesto, fiction) representing that -ism. Ideally, this text will have significant or notable design elements. Thoroughly describe the aesthetic (style, composition, materials), political (ideologies, representations, biases), and cultural (community, modes of expression) contexts of your text.  

## Week 4 | 25 January | Make It Page Images. 

When is text also image? How are screens entangled in interpretation? 

Read: Selections from Drucker, [*Figuring the Word*](http://www.granarybooks.com/books/drucker3/drucker3.1.html)
Notebook: Digitize or acquire your text as a series of page images (TIFF, JPG, PNG). Interpret the text as image on a screen. 

## Week 5 | 1 February | Make It Metadata. 

When is text merely its description? Where is metadata beyond keeping texts found?  

Read: Schnapp, "Small Data: The Intimate Lives of Cultural Objects"
Notebook: Articulate ten metadata fields for your text and provide data for each field. Interpet the text as metadata.  

## Week 6 | 8 February 

No seminar. This is Family Day.  

## Week 7 | 15 February | Make It ASCII. Mark It Up.  

Why would we ever want plain text? How is text processed? 

Read: Selections from Tenen, *Plain Text*  
Notebook: Generate an ASCII, or plain text, version of your text, removing all formatting. Interpret the text as plain text. Then encode your text in HTML5. Interpret it as markup. 

## Week 8 | 22 February | Change the Typeface. Print + Assemble It.

What is the relation between print and digital typography? How do we think about them together? 

Read: Selections from Bringhurst, [*The Elements of Typographic Style*](http://uvic.summon.serialssolutions.com/#!/search?bookMark=ePnHCXMw42JgAfZbU5khZ9tYWAAj3Ag888YFig9glFuCrizmAJ1LZQxMLBzQuDcEFZJGphacDIrA8FFIhaydLlbIT1MoqSyAnN6cmaxQXFIJKjal3VxDnD10QftQ4qHDHPGGxqYGRpagmyVVIbKo08jxiaCB_PggA2CDwMzSFLTRCJ8pAHNINns) 
Notebook: Change the typeface of your text, print it, and assemble it as a booklet. Intepret the text as type.  

## Week 9 | 29 February | Make It a Form. 

When and why do texts become documents? How do they gather and store information? 

Read: Selections from Gitelman, [*Paper Knowledge*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Paper-Knowledge/) 
Notebook: Convert your text into a fillable form. Have at least three other people complete it. Interpret the text as a document.   

## Week 10 | 7 March | Reverse It. 

How are texts treated as performances? How is text welded to reading?

## Week 12 | 21 March | Repair It. 

How do we conduct reparative readings of texts? To what affect on suspicion? 

Read: Selections from Sedgwick, [*Touching Feeling*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/Touching-Feeling/index-viewby=subject&categoryid=44&sort=author.html) 
Notebook: Repair your redacted, glitched text. Interpret the text as a repaired object.    

## Week 13 | 28 March 

No seminar. This is Easter Monday.  

## Week 14 | 4 April | Make it _______. 

It's your turn. Looking forward to hearing your ideas and seeing your prototypes! 

Notebook: Cook up your own exercise. Run an experiment. Interpret the results. Present them during seminar.  

## Week 15 | Portfolio 

Please compile all of your materials, across tactile and digital media, into a portfolio using an approach of your choice. With the portfolio, include a brief cover letter describing the effects of your various alterations. Please note: a cover letter is not a seminar paper or journal article. For the purposes of this seminar, it should describe, reflect, and project, not analyze, deconstruct, or interrogate.
