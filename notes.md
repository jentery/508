## Week 1 | 4 January | Interpretation through Alteration

Hello! Welcome to 508. I'm looking forward to it. At some point during our meeting, we should introduce ourselves and briefly review the [syllabus](index.html).

## Assumptions

Let's start with some common assumptions about digital humanities (DH). 

* The field is a service. It merely develops and maintains digital resources for researchers. It does not interpret or meaningfully engage with pre-digital traditions in literary and cultural criticism.  
* DH does not concern itself with the literary or aesthetic character of texts. It does not do hermeneutics. Instead, it is instrumentalist in character: a techno-solutionist byproduct of positivism and big data. It bypasses fiction and poetry for gadgets and whiz-bang.  
* DH practitioners replace cultural perspectives with uncritical computer vision. Instead of privileging irony or ambiguity, they use computers to "prove" reductive claims about literature and culture, usually through graphs and totalizing visualizations. Literature and critical theory are relegated to investments in data.  
* To participate in the field, you must be fluent in computer programming, or at least willing to treat literature and culture quantitatively. If you are not a programmer, then you are not doing digital humanities. 

## Counter-assumptions

During this seminar, I suggest we complicate and counter these assumptions by: 

* Doing digital studies without much, if any, interest in programming. For instance, I will not require you to conduct any programming exercises during workshops or outside of seminar. If you wish to apply programming to the material, then feel free. (I enjoy programming, too.)
* Experimenting with a speculative thread of digital studies that is interested less in visualization, graphical expression, or big data and more in close reading, small data, and affordances (immeasurable yet specific relations between "animal and environment"; see [J.J. Gibson in 1979 on "The Ambient Optic Array"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/gibsonVisualPerception.pdf)). 
* Accounting for the ways in which art resists, diffracts, or escapes interpretation (or remediation) by computer vision. This may be something as basic as text that is not conducive to either optical character recognition or search mechanisms; we might also consider the categorization and indexing of art via practices such as descriptive metadata.
* Historicizing digital studies through legacies of experimental media and aesthetics at work prior to personal computing and the internet. One trick here will be negotiating our relationship with the "avant-garde." For instance, can we balance assertions for autonomy or rupture with materialist investments in the everyday? 
* Thinking through paradigms that do not privilege legibility, speed, massiveness, mining, or even discovery. Important question: can you manage such paradigms without relying on romantic individualism, or without assuming we can "withdraw" from the systems we interpret? I ask because I'm personally skeptical of recent, rather nostalgic obsessions with pre-digital living and labour. Can we maintain critiques of computational or algorithmic logic without inventing (or assuming) a history of "simpler times"? While I don't want to rely too much on qualifiers such as "pre" and "post," I do wonder if we might unpack something like a "post-digital" approach to print and old media. This approach might involve locating new media (see [Manovich in 2001 on "What Is New Media?"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/manovichNewMedia.pdf)) in our everyday lives (as a given, as something banal or familiar) to then prototype alternative histories and possibilities. This way, "digital" is not synonymous with "novel." Maybe it's even boring.     
* Conducting a series of experiments that blend technique with abstraction, stuff with ideas, maintenance with novelty, and material particulars with politics and aesthetics.  
* Resisting a "make or break" logic, with a bias toward "care and repair" as practices fundamental to literary and cultural practice. Later in the term, we'll specifically talk about alternatives to suspicion. For now, we might highlight how innovation and obsolescence operate through technologies (or "technocultures"; see [Andrew Ross in 1990](http://pmc.iath.virginia.edu/text-only/issue.990/ross-1.990)).  

## Postulations

To manage all of this, I propose we entertain a series of postulations for the seminar. They are below, with some references to the scholarship informing them. We'll discuss the consequences or implications of these postulations by anchoring them in a series of exercises, where each of you will repeatedly alter a single text (of your choice) using specific techniques (e.g., ["reverse it,"](index.html#week-10) ["redact it,"](index.html#week-11) ["glitch it"](index.html#week-11)). Together, these acts of alteration may be understood as prototyping: testing interpretations as they manifest in physical or tactile form.    

* *What if digital studies is primarily about design? Or, what happens if we privilege design as a way to interpret literary and cultural history?* These questions are especially inspired by the work of [Anne Balsamo, who (in "Design," published in 2010](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/balsamoDesign.pdf)) outlines four ways of understanding design: 

	* "aesthetic embellishments or nonfunctional aspects of a product or application," where, in an aesthetic tradition, design is separate from its object; 
	* "a solution to a problem," where, in an engineering tradition, design is associated with an evaluable task addressed at a puzzle of sorts;
	*  "a domain of creative expression," where design, in an arts tradition, stresses the practices through which materials are shaped into an art form; and 
	* "a practice of cultural reproduction," where design, in a cultural studies (or "design studies") tradition, where design is studied as a combination of "ontological frameworks, methodologies, institutional formations, and cultural manifestations" (Balsamo 2010: 2). 

	Later, Balsamo argues that people (or, more specifically, designers) should be "encouraged to develop a robust imagination about *what could and should* be done differently with technologies that are already in existence" (2010: 7). Put this way, design should be not only be described and theorized but also exercised. In this seminar, we might replace Balsamo's "technologies" with "texts," asking ourselves what could and should be done differently with texts already in existence. 

	Additionally, we might follow Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby, who (in *Speculative Everything*, published in 2013), point to fiction as a way of thinking about "critical design," which is not art but rather "an alternative to how things are. It is the gap between reality as we know it and the different idea of reality referred to in . . . [a] proposal that creates space for discussion" (Dunne and Raby 2013: 35). When we prototype texts in this seminar, we might approach them as gaps between history as we know it and a different idea of history referenced by the altered text at hand.    

* *What if that design practice is about both speculation and repair? Or, what if the history of literature and culture is a broken world?* This postulation prompts us to approach literary and cultural history as states of constant change across contexts, formats, media, audiences, archives . . . . The list goes on. In a way, digital studies stewards those changes, always with possible futures in mind. 

	When prototyping texts, we might follow [Guilford's Alternative Uses Task](http://www.indiana.edu/~bobweb/r546/modules/creativity/creativity_tests/guilford_uses_task.html) to list as many possible manifestations of a single text. What if it were a . . . ? Or a . . . ? Then we can produce these versions and interpret them accordingly.  

	In [the work of Daniela Rosner and Morgan Ames](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/rosnerAmesDesigningForRepair.pdf) (2014), such iteration stresses matters of "negotiated endurance," or "the ways that maintenance, care, and repair are negotiated—often collaboratively—in use and the meaning-making associated with use, rather than the meanings pre-specified by designers" (Rosner and Ames 2014: 9). For us, questions of negotiated endurance may involve attending to issues that authors of text cannot anticipate (e.g., what will happen to their work as conditions change). They may also nudge us to research the historical and material particulars of texts: who made them, when, and how, together with how they've migrated, morphed, or "broken down" (whatever that means for a text). What's more, negotiated endurance should help us account for matters of provenance, variance, witnessing, circulation, and appropriation (e.g., who should alter or recontextualize a text, in what form, with what acknowledgments, and under what assumptions).

	[Stephen Jackson's notion of "broken world thinking"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/jacksonRethinkingRepair.pdf) is helpful here, too. Jackson warns us of "the twin analytic dangers of nostalgia and heroism" (2014: 233). Through broken world thinking, he suggests:

	* thinking beyond the binaries of "senders and receivers, producers and consumers, designers and users" (2014: 234);
	* directing our attention away from novelty (or "the shock of the new") toward "the myriad forms of activity by which the shape, standing, and meaning of objects in the world [are] produced and sustained" (2014: 234); 
	* expanding our understanding of timelines beyond origin stories and ruptures toward the longer shelf life of material culture, including its maintenance and repair (2014: 234); 
	* "building bridges to new and adjacent fields" (2014: 235), which, in this case, include bridges between technology studies (Jackson's field) and media, literary, cultural, and design studies; and 
	* "positioning the world of things as an active component and partner in the ongoing project of building more humane, just, and sustainable collectives" (2014: 235). Here, it is important to note that, for Jackson, things are not a fetish. They are closer to congealed processes or tactile relationships.  

	As Jackson acknowledges, broken world thinking corresponds with how Walter Benjamin perceived history, "collecting and recuperating the world around him" (Jackson 2014: 237). For this seminar, how might the alteration of texts (however fragmentary) also be an act of recuperation? 

* *What if interpretation manifests through not only text but also prototypes? What do literary prototypes do, and how?* Thus far, these questions have been running in the background of the postulations, so I'll foreground them here. While scholarship in design often treats text as the enemy, we might instead think about design and text, or design and prototyping, together. 

	Such gestures have plenty of precedent in the humanities. For me, [Johanna Drucker's work on artist's books](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/druckerFiguringTheWord.pdf) immediately comes to mind; there, the word is image, part of a long history of graphic design. [Drucker's speculative computing work with Bethany Nowviskie](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405103213/9781405103213.xml&chunk.id=ss1-4-10) is also relevant: "Our goal is to place the hermeneut inside a visual and algorithmic system, where his or her very presence alters an otherwise mechanistic process at the quantum level" (Drucker and Nowviskie 2004: n. pag.). Textual systems become arranged systems we may inhabit and even alter.     
	
	Many also reference [Bruce Sterling's notion of "design fiction,"](http://jenteryteaches.com/noneshall/508/sterlingDesignFiction.pdf), which combines design (as "a method of action," following Charles Eames) with literature (as "a method of meaning and feeling") (Sterling 2009: 24). While we might dispute Sterling's formation here, we now see design fiction at work across labs, studios, conferences, and the like. For instance, the MIT Media Lab has a [Design Fiction research group](https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/design-fiction).

	In digital humanities, there's [Kari Kraus's "Conjectural Criticism"](http://digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/3/4/000069/000069.html), published in 2009. Kraus's work deeply informs this seminar: "examples of conjecture include the recovery of lost readings in classical texts and the computational modeling of the evolution of a literary work" (Karus 2009: para. 4). She argues: "We might, for starters, imagine conjecture as a knowledge toolkit designed to perform 'what if' analyses across a range of texts. In this view, the text is a semiotic system whose discrete units of information can be artfully manipulated into alternate configurations that may represent past or future states" (2009: para. 15).
